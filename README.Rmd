Our package offers a suite of functions for performing mediation analysis with
high-dimensional mediators. Unlike methods for single-mediator mediation
analysis---which have been distributed by packages such as "[psych](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=psych)," "[mediation](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mediation),"
"[medScan](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=medScan)"---our package 
focuses on settings whether there are many potential mediators that need 
evaluating simultaneously, a topic which has recently become the focus of prolific
and exciting methodological work. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of hdmed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dclarkboucher/hdmed")
```

## Example

To demonstrate high-dimensional mediation analysis with an example, let $A$ be
an exposure, $Y$ an outcome, $\mathbf{C}$ a set of $q$ covariates, and 
$\mathbf{M}$ a set of $p$ potential mediators in the causal pathway between $A$
and $Y$. Then, supposing we have data on $n$ individuals, we can evaluate the
mediating role of $\mathbf{M}$ with the equations

$$
\begin{equation}
E[Y_i|A_i,\mathbf{M}_i,\mathbf{C_i}] = \beta_aA_i+\mathbf{\beta_m}^T\mathbf{M_i} + \mathbf{\beta_c}^T\mathbf{C_i} 
\end{equation}
$$

and 

$$
\begin{equation}
E[\mathbf{M_i}|A_i,\mathbf{C_i}] =\mathbf{\alpha_a}A_i + \mathbf{\alpha_c}\mathbf{C_i} 
\end{equation}
$$

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

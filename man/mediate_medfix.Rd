\arguments{
\item{A}{length \code{n} numeric vector representing the exposure variable}

\item{M}{\code{n x p} numeric matrix of high-dimensional mediators.}

\item{Y}{length \code{n} numeric vector representing the continuous outcome variable.}

\item{C1}{optional numeric matrix of covariates to include in the outcome model.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{C2}{optional numeric matrix of covariates to include in the mediator
model. Default is \code{C1}.}

\item{nlambda}{number of lambdas attempted in the adaptive LASSO.
See \code{\link[gcdnet:cv.gcdnet]{gcdnet::cv.gcdnet()}}. The specific sequence of \code{lambda}s is chosen
by the \code{cv.gcdnet()} function.}

\item{nlambda2}{number of \code{lambda2}s attempted in the initial elastic net
used for computing adaptive weights prior to adaptive LASSO. Default is \code{50}.
See \code{\link[gcdnet:cv.gcdnet]{gcdnet::cv.gcdnet()}} for details on elastic net regression. If \code{0},
\code{lambda2=0} is fed to \code{cv.gcdnet()} and the initial fit is based on
standard LASSO, not elastic net. If not \code{0)}, the specific sequence of
\code{lambda2}s is given by \code{exp(seq(1e-4,0.02,length.out=nlambda2))}, and
the \code{lambda2} with the least cross-validated error is chosen.}

\item{nfolds}{number of folds for cross-validation. See \code{\link[gcdnet:cv.gcdnet]{gcdnet::cv.gcdnet()}}.
Default is \code{10}.}

\item{seed}{numeric random seed.}

\value{
A list containing:

of the mediation contributions}

mediation, and total effects}

\description{
\code{mediate_medfix} fits a high-dimensional mediation model with
the adaptive LASSO approach as proposed by Zhang (2021) for the
special case of MedFix that there is only one exposure variable.
}
\details{
MedFix performs mediation analysis when there are multiple mediators by
applying adaptive LASSO to the outcome model. In order to fit the adaptive LASSO,
we first obtain an initial model fit using either LASSO (which deploys
the L1 penalty) or elastic net (which deploys both the L1 and L2 penalties)
depending on the provided \code{nlambda2}. Estimates from this fit are then used
to compute the adaptive weights used in the adaptive LASSO. Once the final
adaptive LASSO estimates (\eqn{\beta_m}) are obtained for the outcome model, estimates for
the \code{p} mediator models (\eqn{\alpha_a}) are obtained by linear regression. The
mediation contributions are computed as \eqn{\alpha_a} times \eqn{\beta_m}, and the p-value
is taken as the maximum of the \eqn{\alpha_a} and \eqn{beta_m} p-values. Last, the
global indirect effect is estimated by summing the mediation contributions, and the direct
effect is estimated by subtracting the global indirect effect from an estimate of
the total effect. This function is specific to applying MedFix to the special
case that there is only one exposure; for details on how to apply
MedFix when the exposures are high-dimensional, as proposed by the
authors, see the supplemental files of the referenced manuscript.

\item{Y}{length \code{n} numeric vector containing continuous outcome variable.}

\item{C1}{optional numeric matrix of covariates to include in the outcome model.}

\item{C2}{optional numeric matrix of covariates to include in the mediator
model. Default is \code{C1}.}

\item{burnin}{number of MCMC draws prior to sampling.}

\item{ndraws}{number of MCMC draws after burn-in.}

\item{ci_level}{the desired credible interval level. Default is 0.95.}

\item{k}{shape parameter for the inverse gamma priors. Default is 2.}

\item{lm0}{scale parameter for the inverse gamma prior on the variance of the
smaller-variance normal components. Default is \code{1e-4}. If \code{k=2},
this parameter equals the prior mean on the smaller normal variance.}

this parameter equals the prior mean on the larger normal variance of the
mediator-outcome associations.}

\description{
\code{mediate_bslmm} fits the Bayesian sparse linear mixed model proposed by
Song et al. (2020) for high-dimensional mediation analysis, estimating the
mediation contributions of potential mediators.
}
\details{
\code{mediate_bslmm} is a wrapper function for the "BSLMM" option from \code{\link[bama:bama]{bama::bama()}},
which fits a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model for performing mediation
analysis with high-dimensional mediators. The model assumes that
the mediator-outcome associations (\eqn{\beta_m}) and the exposure-mediator
associations (\eqn{\alpha_a}) independently follow a mixture of small-variance
and high-variance normal distributions, and that if a mediator \eqn{M_j} has both
\eqn{(\beta_m)_j} and \eqn{(\alpha_a)_j} belonging to the larger-variance distribution,
it has a notably large mediation contribution compared to the others. The
posterior inclusion probability (PIP) of belonging to both larger-variance
distributions is reported for each mediator as \code{ab_pip}.

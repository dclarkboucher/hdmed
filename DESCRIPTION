Description: A suite of functions for performing mediation
    analysis when the mediators are high-dimensional. In addition to 
    centralizing the many existing packages for high-dimensional mediation, we 
    provide organized, well-documented functions for a handle of methods which, 
    though programmed originally by their respective authors, have not 
    previously been formalized into R packages or been made suitable for public 
    use. The methods we include cover a broad array of approaches and 
    objectives, and are described in detail in both our companion 
    manuscript--"Methods for Mediation Analysis with High-Dimensional DNA 
    Methylation Data: Possible Choices and Comparison"--as well as their 
    original papers. The methods offered by our package include the Bayesian
    sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM) by Song et al. (2019), high-dimensional 
    mediation analysis by Gao et al. (2019), high-dimensional multivariate 
    mediation (HDMM) by ChÃ©n et al. (2018), high-dimensional linear mediation 
    analysis (HILMA) by Zhou et al. (2020), high-dimensional mediation analysis
    by Zhang et al. (2016), latent variable mediation analysis (LVMA) by Derkach 
    et al. (2019), mediation by fixed-effect model (MedFix) by Zhang (2021), 
    pathway LASSO by Zhao & Luo (2022), principal component mediation analysis 
    (PCMA) by Huang & Pan (2016), and sparse principal component mediation 
    analysis by Zhao et al. (2020). References for the original papers can be 
    found in their respective functions.

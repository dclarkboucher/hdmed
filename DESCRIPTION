Description: MultiMed provides a suite of functions for performing mediation
    analysis when the mediators are high-dimensional. In addition to 
    centralizing the many existing packages for high-dimensional mediation, we 
    provide organized, well-documented functions for a handle of methods which, 
    though programmed originally by their respective authors, have not 
    previously been formalized into R packages or been made suitable for public 
    use. The methods we include cover a broad array of approaches and 
    objectives, and are described in detail in both our companion 
    manuscript--"Methods for Mediation Analysis with High-Dimensional DNA 
    Methylation Data: Possible Choices and Comparison"--as well as their 
    original papers. The methods offered by our package include BSLMM (Song et 
    al. 2019), HDMA (Gao et al. 2019), HDMM (also called PDMs) (ChÃ©n et al. 
    2018), HILMA (Zhou et al. 2020), HIMA (Zhang et al. 2016), LVMA (Derkach et 
    al. 2019), MedFix (Zhang 2021), pathway LASSO (Zhao & Luo 2022), PCMA (Huang 
    & Pan 2016), and SPCMA (Zhao et al. 2020). References for the original 
    papers can be found in their respective functions.
